# PROJECT OVERVIEW:
Tools Used: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib), Excel
### Description:
Conducted a data analysis project on video game performance across platforms and regions using two interconnected datasets:
Game Dataset: Contained metadata including Game ID, Title, Genre, Release Date, and Developer.
Sales Dataset: Included sales metrics such as Platform, Sales Region, Units Sold, and Price.

### Key Contributions:
Merged and cleaned datasets to create a unified view of game sales and metadata.
Analyzed sales trends across genres, platforms, and regions.
Identified top-performing developers and games based on revenue and units sold.

# OBJECTIVE:
To analyze and interpret video game sales data in order to uncover trends, performance patterns, and market insights across different platforms, genres, and regionsâ€”ultimately supporting data-driven decision-making for game development and marketing strategies.

# SUMMARY:
Utilized Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) to analyze global video game sales data. Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify top-selling genres, regional sales patterns, pricing impact on sales, and developer performance. Created insightful visualizations including bar charts, line plots, scatter plots, pie charts, box plots, and heatmaps to communicate key trends and correlations. Improved data storytelling by labeling plots, customizing axes, and highlighting key findings.
